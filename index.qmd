I am currently a senior at **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** double-majoring in **Mathematics/Economics and Statistics & Data Science**. I also aim to declare my **Specialization in Computing** before graduation. Majoring in these subjects helped me build a solid quantitative background and strengthened my logical thinking and data analysis skills. 

I was very interested in business in general when I first entered college, so I further explored the field by actively participating in consulting clubs. I later discovered my more specific passion in finance through several internships related to factor investing and private equity. 

Apart from my academic interests, Iâ€™m also actively involved in extracurricular clubs on campus related to professional development and volunteering. During my free time, I also like to sing and dance with my friends in a cappella groups and dance clubs.
