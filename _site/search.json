    "text": "I am currently a senior at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) double-majoring in Mathematics/Economics and Statistics & Data Science. I also aim to declare my Specialization in Computing before graduation. Majoring in these subjects helped me build a solid quantitative background and strengthened my logical thinking and data analysis skills.\nI was very interested in business in general when I first entered college, so I further explored the field by actively participating in consulting clubs. I later discovered my more specific passion in finance through several internships related to factor investing and private equity.\nApart from my academic interests, I’m also actively involved in extracurricular clubs on campus related to professional development and volunteering. During my free time, I also like to sing and dance with my friends in a cappella groups and dance clubs.\nResume: Resume"
